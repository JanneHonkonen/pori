PORI - The satakunta programming language

*A Work very In Progress.

PORI, acronym pending, is a Finnish programming language based of the beatiful dialect of the Pori, originating from the Finnish city of Pori, located in Satakunta.

As a husband of the geniune former barefoot Pori-born resident, I felt urge to create a Pori-based programming language.

Generally speaking, people of Pori are on of their kind. There is a saying in Finland, the Devils of Pori or "Porin pirut" about the people of the Pori. They are straightforward, blunt and some may even say hostile, towards eachother and specially towards outsiders, but there is nothing more pure than their love towards their hockey team, Porin Ässät and hatred towards their neighbouring city, Rauma.

This project is done in my freetime and was started on Spring 2021 because during pandemic, there is not much better to do.
